This project will be set up much like a searching system.
What it will search through are an accumulation of mathematical formula,
You will be given the option to pick a math equation and see it worked
out, as it prints to the command line.

The Goal is to build a fun little system that can help people understand
how to traverse through math problems.

As of now its not very impressive, but this is a project that I've been
wanting to work on since i first learned how to code. I will continue to
update with new formula, and also inprove on the build since it is not up
to my standards as of now!
